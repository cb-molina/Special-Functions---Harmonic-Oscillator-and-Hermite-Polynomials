# Special-Functions---Harmonic-Oscillator-and-Hermite-Polynomials
The harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics is used to describe the oscillatory behavior of a particle within a smooth well of potential energy, and is the quantummechanical analog of the classical harmonic oscillator. The one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is a simplified model describing the probability of finding a particle within a potential well based on its excitation levels. A particle at its ground state would likely be found at the bottom of the potential well, but as energy levels increase, probability density begins to peak where the excitation levels coincides with the potential energy. At higher excitation levels, the quantum harmonic oscillator begins to reflect the behavior of the classical harmonic oscillator. This is considered the correspondence principle, in which ”overall picture of probability of finding the oscillator at a given value of x converges for the quantum and classical pictures.”   we will generate solutions to the one dimensional harmonic oscillator using Hermite polynomials, then observe the probability density wave function as excitation levels increase to reflect the correspondence principle
